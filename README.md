### Week 1
This week we started by presenting the idea for our application for the rest of the group.
We also finished our low fi prototype.

We decided on using 5 screens for the application. The inital screen which only has a start button. We also discussed having a level picker at this screen, but this wont be implemented unless we feel we have time left in the end of the project. The second screen consist of the search-for-the-treasure-part of the game, which we decided will be a compass. The screen will also show the over all progress, in a bar. This is where the player collects their total points. 

The two next screens are the digging and blowing screens, which are very similar and gives the user two very different way of interacting with the game. The last screen will consist of a quiz. We decided this quiz will be in the form of a multiple choice test, which the user has to pass to get the treasure.
